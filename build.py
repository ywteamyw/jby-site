"""Assemble the Jeff Brown Yachts site.

Every page keeps living in the repo it was built in; here we take the deployed HTML,
give it a <base> so all of its own assets keep resolving, and inject the shared site
chrome (global menu + link rewiring). The result is one site: / is the home page and
every other page sits underneath it.
